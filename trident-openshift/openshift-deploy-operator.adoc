You can deploy the Trident operator to install Trident on Red Hat OpenShift. This process applies to installations where the container images required by Trident are not stored in a private registry.

.Before you begin 
Before you begin installation, log in to the Linux host and verify it is managing a working, link:requirements.html[supported Kubernetes cluster^] and that you have the necessary privileges.

NOTE: With OpenShift, use `oc` instead of `kubectl` in all of the examples that follow, and log in as *system:admin* first by running `oc login -u system:admin` or `oc login -u kube-admin`.

== Critical information about Trident 24.10
*You must read the following critical information about Trident.*

// Start snippet: collapsible block (open on page load)
.*Critical information about Trident*

====
=======
* Red Hat OpenShift 4.17 is supported in Trident. Upgrade Trident prior to upgrading Red Hat OpenShift.
* Trident strictly enforces the use of multipathing configuration in SAN environments, with a recommended value of `find_multipaths: no` in multipath.conf file. 
+
Use of non-multipathing configuration or use of `find_multipaths: yes` or `find_multipaths: smart` value in multipath.conf file will result in mount failures. Trident has recommended the use of `find_multipaths: no` since the 21.07 release.

== Deploy the Trident via the Red Hat OpenShift Console
Review link:../trident-get-started/kubernetes-deploy.html[the installation overview^] to ensure you've met installation prerequisites and selected the correct installation option for your environment.

=== Step 1: Deploy the Trident operator from OperatorHub 

Navigate to the ```Operators/OperaratorHub````, search for NetApp, and click on NetApp Trident:

A pop-up might appear to inform you about the support of Trident is provided by NetApp and not Red Hat:

The Trident operator page will open providing all the necessary information about version and capabilities. Click the ```Install``` button to continue:

=== Step 2: Create the `TridentOrchestrator` CRD
Create the `TridentOrchestrator` Custom Resource Definition (CRD). You creates a `TridentOrchestrator` Custom Resources later. Use the appropriate CRD YAML version in `deploy/crds` to create the `TridentOrchestrator` CRD.
